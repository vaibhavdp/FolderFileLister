# FolderFileLister
Lists files within the current and each sub-folder path.


This is a simple to use C# Windows Forms application, using BackgroundWorker class, 
with a single purpose of listing all the files in the current folder, 
and recursively into each sub-folder.

It outputs the results as a Numbered list, so that we come to know the number of files in each folder.

It was created mainly for Listing of Songs in a huge Music Collection (over 5000 songs).
